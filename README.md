# Python Tutorials
<li/>Here you can find different python tutorials for the beginner data scientist.
<li/>I assume that you have some background in programming, not necessarily in Pythons (you are familiar with IF conditions and with FOR loops).
<li/>You should work with Anaconda or with a cloud environment such as Google Colab.
